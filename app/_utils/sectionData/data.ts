                            I am a highly adaptive software developer with 2 years of experience graduating from NIT Agartala in 2025. I am super excited to learn from your engineering team and provide users with better experiences.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Over the last 2 years, I have helped my company Fleckslabs generate over $5 million in revenue by shipping 8 core products while leading the Front End Development team. And now I am excited to continue my journey by contributing and growing with you. There are two things that make me a perfect fit for this position:
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Firstly, I have always been a thoughtful problem solver. As the full stack developer at Fleckslabs, I understood and adapted to technological requirements of the different clients, extensively researched and solved the problem following industry best practices, wrote clean, documented code with proper tests. I always learned new technologies as per the demand of clients and, while applying them in real-world scenarios, gained proficiency in them.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            I learned React, Node.js, Flutter, .NET, Ionic, MySQL, REST APIs, PostgreSQL, AWS, Firebase using languages like TypeScript, JavaScript, C#, C++, HTML, CSS, Dart. These technical skills that I built up helped my company gain more projects, and I was always the go-to person on my team to help debug technical issues.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Secondly, I always think from the users’ perspective while building products. I have been freelancing for the last 4 months, and there I have developed apps for detecting medical symptoms, finding rental spaces, and connecting indigenous Indian artists with work opportunities. The positive feedback from the users has made me realize the impact these products have on the lives of many. So I dedicate myself to crafting the best experience for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think you'll find that my experience is a really good fit for your team and specifically this position. I'm ready to take my skills to the next level with your team and look forward to hearing back.
                        </p>
